# Security Policy

## Overview

BC64Keys is a keyboard remapping utility that requires **Accessibility permissions** to function. This means the app has the technical capability to observe keystrokes system-wide.

**We take security extremely seriously.**

### Our Security Commitments

- ✅ **100% Open Source** — The entire codebase is public and auditable (GPL-3.0)
- ✅ **Single-file design** — The core app is ~2,100 lines in one file for easy security review
- ✅ **No network access** — BC64Keys works completely offline
- ✅ **No data collection** — Your keystrokes are never logged, stored, or transmitted
- ✅ **No external dependencies** — Pure Swift/SwiftUI, no third-party libraries
- ✅ **Apple Notarized** — Verified and signed by Apple's security team
- ✅ **Secure file permissions** — Log files use 0o600 (owner-only) permissions

### What BC64Keys Does With Your Keystrokes

BC64Keys uses macOS's Accessibility API (`CGEvent` tap) to:
1. **Observe** keystrokes in real-time
2. **Transform** them according to your configured mappings
3. **Forward** the modified events to the system

**Keystrokes are processed in-memory only and are never stored.**

You can verify this yourself by reviewing [`Sources/BC64Keys/BC64KeysApp.swift`](Sources/BC64Keys/BC64KeysApp.swift).

## Security Best Practices for Users

### ✅ Verify App Authenticity

Always download BC64Keys from:
- ✅ **Official GitHub Releases:** https://github.com/TimMacy/BC64Keys/releases
- ❌ **NOT from third-party sites**

### ✅ Check Code Signature

After downloading, verify the app is signed:

```bash
codesign -vv --deep --strict /Applications/BC64Keys.app
```

Expected output should include:
```
Signed Time: [timestamp]
Authority=Developer ID Application: [Developer Name]
...
satisfies its Designated Requirement
```

### ✅ Review Source Code

Before trusting any keyboard monitoring app:
1. Read the source code: [`BC64KeysApp.swift`](Sources/BC64Keys/BC64KeysApp.swift)
2. Build from source yourself using `./build.sh`
3. Compare the SHA-256 of the downloaded DMG/ZIP with the hash GitHub shows on the release asset (or in the release notes):

```bash
shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/BC64Keys-v1.9.2.dmg
```

### ✅ Monitor App Behavior

- Check network activity: BC64Keys should have **ZERO** network connections
- Monitor file system: BC64Keys only writes to:
  - `~/Library/Application Support/BC64Keys/mappings.json` (your settings)
  - `~/Library/Logs/BC64Keys/bc64keys-status.log` (debug logs)

## Scope

### In Scope

- ✅ Keystroke logging vulnerabilities
- ✅ Unauthorized file access
- ✅ Privilege escalation
- ✅ Code injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Memory corruption issues

### Out of Scope

- ❌ Accessibility API design (macOS system limitation)
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Physical access attacks
- ❌ Issues in dependencies we don't control (macOS itself)
